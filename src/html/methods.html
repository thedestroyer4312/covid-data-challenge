        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <p>Here are the methods used to calculate risk scores found in the quiz.</p>

        <p><strong>Age: </strong>Age risk level was determined by taking the “percentage” value and multiplying it by 4.4 to scale it from 0-100.
            The data was taken from the following dataset: </p>
        <p><strong>Race: </strong>Race risk level was determined by taking the “percentage” value and multiplying it by 2.4 to scale it from 0-100.
            The data was taken from the following dataset:</p>
        <p> <strong>Location: </strong>Location risk level was determined by taking the “percentage of national cases” and multiplying it by 6
            to scale it from 0-100. The data was taken from the following dataset: </p>
        <p> <strong>Occupation/Jobs: </strong> Risk Level was determined by each occupation ranking from 1-100 on risk of getting COVID-19.
            The data was taken from the following dataset: <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-front-line-visualizing-the-occupations-with-the-highest-covid-19-risk/">HERE</a> </p>
        <p> <strong>Activity risk: </strong>Activities were categorized based on a risk from 1-5, then expanded to fit the scale of 1-100.
            These activities were categorized based on data from the following website. <a href="https://hartfordhealthcare.org/about-us/news-press/news-detail?articleid=26936&publicId=395">HERE</a></p>
        <p> <strong>Mask wearing: </strong> Mask risk level was calculated based on data from the following website that stated
            the rate of COVID-19 transmission based on whether or not an individual wore a mask. <a href="https://www.livescience.com/face-masks-eye-protection-covid-19-prevention.html">HERE</a></p>
        <p> <strong>Social Distancing: </strong>Social Distancing risk level was calculated based on distance. For each meter of distancing between two people was a range (from low to high) of risk that the individual would have.
            The data was pulled from the following website. <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltext"> HERE </a> </p>
